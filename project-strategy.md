==================

Acronym: TRUSTEDAI
Title: Developing novel explainable AI methods, privacy-preserving techniques, real-time threat detection frameworks, open-source tools, policy recommendations, and European standardisation bodies involvement.
Objectives:
1. Develop explainable AI methods suitable for high-stakes decision support in public services
2. Design and validate AI-driven cybersecurity monitoring frameworks that detect and respond to threats in real time across distributed digital infrastructure
3. Create privacy-preserving AI techniques (e.g., federated learning, differential privacy) that comply with GDPR while maintaining model performance
4. Build open-source AI toolkits and benchmarks for trustworthiness assessment
5. Demonstrate the developed solutions through at least two real-world pilot deployments in different EU Member States
Consortium: Mixed (academic, SMEs, NGOs/Government bodies) from at least three EU Member States or Horizon Europe Associated Countries
Duration: 36 months
Budget: Approximately EUR 4,000,000 per project
